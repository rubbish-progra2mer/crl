# When2Call

When (not) to Call Tools

Leveraging external tools is a key feature for modern Language Models (LMs) to expand their capabilities and integrate them into existing systems. Various tool calling benchmarks have been developed to assess LMs' tool-calling capabilities. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on the accuracy of tool calling --- whether the correct tool is called with the correct parameters --- and less on evaluating *when LMs should (not) call tools*. We develop a new benchmark, **When2Call**, which evaluates tool-calling decision-making: when to generate a tool call, when to ask follow-up questions and when to admit the question can't be answered with the tools provided. and what to do if the question seems to require tool use but a tool call can't be made. We find that state-of-the-art tool-calling LMs show significant room for improvement on **When2Call**, indicating the importance of this benchmark. We also develop a training set for **When2Call** and leverage the multiple-choice nature of the benchmark to develop a preference optimization training regime, which shows considerably more improvement than traditional fine-tuning. This repository contains training and evaluation data along with evaluation code for **When2Call**.

# Results

## MCQ

Results on **When2Call**, BFCL Live AST and BFCL Irrelevance for community tool-calling models, and for our Mistral-NeMo-Minitron (MNM) models with and without training on **When2Call** using SFT and Reward-aware Preference Optimization (RPO). For **When2Call**, we show Macro F1, length-normed accuracy and the tool hallucination rate (lower is better $\downarrow$) when no tools are provided. Models not trained on **When2Call** struggle to make the right choices; RPO training yields the greatest benefits.
