"""Tier 0 certificate floor — exact Clopper–Pearson on observed all-success.

The **primary** reliability floor for a composition that was executed
end-to-end — free of any *inter-stage dependence* assumption (no copula, no
factor model), though **not** assumption-free: it rests on i.i.d. missions and a
fixed, pre-specified scoring rule (see :class:`ObservedFloor`). When every stage
is scored on the *same* missions, the
all-success event ``Y_i = Π_j passes[j, i]`` is **directly observed**, so
``Σ_i Y_i ~ Binomial(n, R)`` with ``R`` the true all-success reliability, and a
one-sided Clopper–Pearson lower bound is an **exact, finite-sample (1 − η) lower
confidence bound on R** under the single assumption that missions are i.i.d.
draws from the certified mission distribution. No copula, no factor model, no
bootstrap, no asymptotics — arbitrary inter-stage dependence is already realised
in the joint outcomes, so nothing needs to be modelled.

This is the value a certificate should print. It dominates the Gaussian
one-factor *model floor* (:mod:`factor_reliability`): at the paper's real sample
sizes it matches it on tightness, and it stays valid under **any** dependence —
including the pairwise-indistinguishable misspecification under which the model
floor's coverage of the true reliability collapses to zero (LLD-B audit F1). It
also prices the boundary correctly: an all-pass sample (``k = n``) yields
``η^{1/n} < 1``, never a spurious ``1.0`` (audit F5).

Use the copula-agnostic pairwise LP floor (:mod:`lp_bound`) instead only when the
composition was **never run end-to-end**, so the joint all-success rate was not
observed and must be bounded from per-stage / pairwise data.
