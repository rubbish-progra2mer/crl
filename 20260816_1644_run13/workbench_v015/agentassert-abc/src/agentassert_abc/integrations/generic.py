"""Generic framework-agnostic adapter.

Works with ANY agent that produces dict output. No framework dependency required.
Internally delegates to SessionMonitor for stateful monitoring.

Patent §3.3: The ContractMiddleware wraps any agent graph and intercepts
state transitions. When a transition occurs, it extracts relevant fields,
evaluates them against the contract, and either allows (compliant),
triggers recovery (soft violation), or raises ContractBreachError (hard violation).

        The evaluator looks fields up as literal dotted keys — ``output.safe``,

        therefore meant a contract written against ``output.safe`` scored
        ``False`` on every step no matter how the agent behaved, while the *same
        contract* evaluated correctly on the enforcement plane, which flattens.
        This makes both planes agree.
