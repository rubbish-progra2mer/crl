"""Base adapter protocol for framework integrations.

Patent §3.3: ContractMiddleware wraps any agent graph and intercepts
state transitions. All framework adapters share a common monitoring interface.

H-06: Redesigned Protocol to match what adapters actually implement.
The common interface is: check(), session_summary(), extract_state().
Framework-specific methods (wrap_node, guardrail, etc.) are NOT in the Protocol.
