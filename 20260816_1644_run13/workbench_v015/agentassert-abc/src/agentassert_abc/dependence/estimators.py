"""Co-failure dependence estimators (LLD-B Sec 4/6, LLD-E Sec 8).

Given paired binary *failure* outcomes for two agents (1 = contract failed),
these estimate how strongly their failures co-occur:

* :func:`jaccard`        — model-free failure-set overlap n11/(n11+n10+n01).
* :func:`kendall_tau_a`  — binary Kendall tau_a = 2(p11*p00 - p10*p01).
* :func:`phi_coefficient` — the phi / point Pearson correlation (= tau_b binary).
* :func:`tetrachoric`     — latent bivariate-normal correlation behind the 2x2.
* :func:`one_factor_loadings` — shared-factor loadings from a correlation matrix
  (identified only with >= 3 indicators).
* :func:`tau_a_min_samples` — the distribution-free sample floor for a tau_a CI.

Design notes:
* Failure convention: ``1`` means the contract failed. Positive dependence
  therefore means "fail together".
* All estimators are immutable and side-effect free; inputs are never mutated.

    The fraction of the two agents' failures that fall on the *same* missions.
    Model-free in the strong sense: unlike :func:`tetrachoric` it assumes no
    latent distribution, and unlike :func:`kendall_tau_a` it is not bounded by
    the marginals — which is why the paper leads Finding 2 with it. When one
    agent fails rarely, tau_a is squeezed toward its marginal ceiling and
    *looks* like decorrelation; Jaccard is not, so it still reports the overlap.

    The ``n00`` cell (both passed) is deliberately excluded: the denominator is
    the *union of the two failure sets*, so missions neither agent failed cannot
    dilute the statistic. That is what keeps Jaccard informative when failures
    are rare.
