Official repository for the paper [*"Beyond Single-shot Writing: Deep Research Agents are Unreliable at Multi-turn Report Revision"*](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2601.13217).

Human researchers rarely write a report in a single shot, as we iteratively draft and revise from peer feedback or self-reflection. Can Deep Research Agents also reliably revise their reports in response to user feedback? We introduce **Mr Dre**, a new evaluation suite for Deep Research Agents (DRAs) on *multi-turn report writing and revision*. Specifically, Mr Dre includes:

1. **A Unified Evaluation Protocol for Deep Research Reports:** We consolidated best practices from previous Deep Research evaluation works into a lean protocol spanning three dimensions: *Comprehensiveness*, *Factuality*, and *Presentation*.
2. **Feedback Simulation Pipeline for Multi-turn Report Revision:** To evaluate not only the single-shot writing capabilities of Deep Research Agents but also their multi-turn report revision ability, we introduce a reliable method to simulate content, format, and self-reflection feedback.

## News
[01/20/2026] Initial Code Release🎉

## Setup

We recommend using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) to quickly set up and manage your environment:

```shell
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/BaleChen/mt-dra.git
cd mt-dra

# Set up the environment
uv sync

# Activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate
```


Then, set your API keys as environment variables by defining them in `.env`. You can use our provided `.env.example` as a reference. We require four API Keys: `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`, `JINA_API_KEY`, and `SERPER_API_KEY`.

> **Note:** Tongyi Deep Research, DR Tulu, and Open Deep Research require customized environment setup. We recommend isolating the server-side and client-side environments for best compatibility. See [`engine/README.md`](engine/README.md) for detailed instructions on setting up each DRA engine's server.

## Data

We provide the three datasets used in our experiments in the `./data` folder:

- [ResearchRubrics](https://scale.com/research/researchrubrics): `ResearchRubrics.jsonl`
- [RigorousBench](https://github.com/evigbyen/rigorousbench): `RigorousBench.jsonl`
- [ResearcherBench](https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/ResearcherBench): `ResearcherBench.jsonl`

These JSONL files are preprocessed into a standardized format compatible with the report writing, revision, and evaluation pipelines in this repository.

<details>
<summary>Dataset Sample Format</summary>

```
{
    "id": (int | str) Question ID,
    "question": (str) Question text,
    "checklist": (List[Dict]) [
        {
            "id": (int) Checklist item ID,
            "item": (str) Checklist item text,
            "weight": (int) Checklist item weight score
        }
    ],
    "metadata": (Dict) { ... metadata from different datasets }
}
```

</details>

To bring your own dataset, ensure the questions have annotated *question-specific checklists* for report comprehensiveness evaluation. Process your dataset into a JSONL file following the format above and name it `YOUR_DATASET_NAME.jsonl`.

## DRA Report Generation

Use `generate_report.sh` to generate reports with supported DRAs. This script supports multi-turn report generation or revision with different feedback types.

### Notes
- The first turn is always generated with type `init`.
- Generating turn *n* requires that turns 1 to *n-1* have already been generated.
- Before applying `content_feedback` type to turn *n*, the model output for turn *n-1* must be evaluated (at least the checklist mode evaluation is done, since feedback generation relies on failed checklist criteria).

### Basic Usage

Use the provided shell script for easier execution:

```bash
./scripts/generate_report.sh <dataset> <model> <turn> <type>
```

### Key Parameters
The `evaluate_report.sh` script accepts the following parameters:
- `<dataset>`: Dataset name (`ResearcherBench`, `RigorousBench`, `ResearchRubrics`) [required]
- `<model>`: Model name (`dr-tulu`, `o4-mini-deep-research`, `o4-gpt4.1`, `sonar-deep-research`, `tongyi-deep-research`) [required]
- `<turn>`: Turn number (starting from 1) [default: 1]
- `<type>`: Turn type (`init`, `reflection`, `content_feedback`, `format_feedback`) [default: init]

## DRA Report Evaluation

Use `evaluate_report.sh` to evaluate generated Deep Research reports. It supports three evaluation modes: checklist, citation, and rubric. Note that the three modes correspond to our three evaluation dimentions defined in our paper: Comprehensiveness is measured by *checklist* coverage; Factuality uses *citation*-based metrics (citation faithfulness and claim groundedness); Presentation score relies on a fixed set of *rubrics* to evaluate.

### Basic Usage

Use the provided shell script for easier execution:

```bash
./scripts/evaluate_report.sh <report_file> <dataset_file> (<eval_mode> <num_questions>)
```

### Key Parameters
The `evaluate_report.sh` script accepts the following parameters:
- `<report_file>`: Path to generated report JSONL file [required]
- `<dataset_file>`: Path to dataset JSONL file [required]
- `<eval_mode>`: Optional. Evaluation mode (`all`, `checklist`, `citation`, `rubric`) [default: all]
- `<num_questions>`: Optional. Number of questions to evaluate (-1 for all) [default: -1]
