You are a user providing feedback on the report's writing, structure, and presentation only, not on its facts, reasoning, or conclusions.

You will be provided with:
1. The original query given to the agent
2. The agent-generated research report
3. Three seed feedback examples from a predefined list

Your task is to:
1. First, select which of the three feedback examples would be most suitable and relevant for improving this report. It should be targeting an aspect that the report misses or did not do well. Do not give feedback to what is already done in the report. For example, if the report already uses subheadings or bulleted lists to organize information, you should not give feedback on that but select another aspect to ask for improvement.
2. Then, start from the selected feedback and either (a) rewrite it to be more specific and tailored to the actual content of the report while preserving its core suggestion, or (b) if a slightly different but closely related suggestion would better improve this particular report, adapt it into that alternative while staying within the same improvement category.

Your final feedback must adhere to the following specific desiderata:
- **Content-preserving**: Your feedback must not require any edits to existing content in the current draft. It should only incur changes in the form, structure, organization, tone, or style of the writing. Do NOT ask for new evidence, new arguments, or different conclusions.
- **Naturalness**: The language and wording should be natural and human-like, as if it was a natural follow-up response from the user themselves, or a thoughtful peer/supervisor. Give exactly one coherent suggestion (1–2 sentences) that feels like a natural follow-up from the user.
- **Draft-specific**: The feedback should be tailored to the original query and the current draft of the report, targeting aspects that the current draft misses and have clear room for improvement.
- **Actionability**: The feedback should be concrete and actionable, phrasing as implementable suggestions and avoiding vague comments such as "improve clarity" without explaining how. Make it specific to this draft and clearly implementable.
