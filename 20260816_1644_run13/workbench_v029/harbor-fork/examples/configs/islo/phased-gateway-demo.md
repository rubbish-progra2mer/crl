# Islo Phased Gateway — Demo Report

**Date:** 2026-05-03
**Branch:** `feat/islo-phased-gateway`
**Goal:** Prove that the per-phase Islo gateway flips at the correct
trial-lifecycle boundaries, with real trial logs and probe output as evidence.

## TL;DR

Five trials were run end-to-end against real Islo infrastructure. All five
passed. Probe logs from the demo task confirm that the proxy enforces the
configured policy in each phase and reverts at the boundary:

| Trial | Configured phases | Result | Agent-phase enforcement | Verifier-phase enforcement |
|-------|-------------------|--------|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| baseline | none | reward=1.0, 17s | no profile created | no profile created |
| allow | `agent: allow-all` | reward=1.0, 19s | permissive | reverted to permissive |
| A | `agent: deny + allowlist` | reward=1.0, 20s | only `api.anthropic.com` reachable | all hosts reachable |
| B | `verifier: deny` | reward=1.0, 18s | all hosts reachable | all hosts blocked |
| C | `setup: deny + 10 rules`, `agent: deny + 1 rule` | reward=1.0, 45s | claude-code install completed under setup-phase deny; agent.run only reached `api.anthropic.com` | all hosts reachable |

The probe logs in trials A and B exhibit the **differential pattern** that
proves the proxy is honoring per-phase mutations on a running sandbox:
hosts that are denied in one phase return `403`, the same hosts return `200`
or `404` after the boundary fires.

## Demo task

`examples/tasks/islo-phased-gateway-demo/` — a minimal task whose
`solution/solve.sh` (oracle agent path) and `tests/test.sh` (verifier) each
run the same probe set against `api.anthropic.com`, `example.com`, and
`pypi.org`. Each probe records phase, URL, HTTP status, and curl exit code.

Configs (this directory):

- `phased-gateway-demo-baseline.yaml` — no gateway config
- `phased-gateway-demo-allow.yaml` — explicit allow-all
- `phased-gateway-demo-A.yaml` — agent-phase deny
- `phased-gateway-demo-B.yaml` — verifier-phase deny
- `phased-gateway-demo-C.yaml` — setup+agent deny with claude-code

---

## Trial baseline — no gateway

Sanity check that the demo task runs in a vanilla Islo sandbox and that the
tenant default permits HTTPS egress.

**Trial log** (gateway lines):
```
(none — no gateway profile created)
```

**Probes:**
```
phase=agent   url=https://api.anthropic.com/  http=404 rc=0
phase=agent   url=https://example.com/        http=200 rc=0
phase=agent   url=https://pypi.org/simple/    http=200 rc=0
phase=verifier url=https://api.anthropic.com/ http=404 rc=0
phase=verifier url=https://example.com/       http=200 rc=0
phase=verifier url=https://pypi.org/simple/   http=200 rc=0
```

Tenant network healthy. Reward 1.0 in 17s.

## Trial allow — explicit permissive profile

Confirms the ephemeral profile lifecycle (create → mutate per phase → delete)
doesn't break egress when the configured policy is permissive.

**Config:**
```yaml
gateway:
  agent:
    default_action: allow
    internet_enabled: true
    rules:
      - host_pattern: "*"
        action: allow
        priority: 100
```

**Trial log** (abridged — only `[gateway]` lines shown; gateway events are
emitted at debug level, surface them with `LOGLEVEL=DEBUG harbor run …`):
```
[gateway] create_gateway_profile name=harbor-... default_action=allow internet_enabled=True (boot permissive)
[gateway] ephemeral profile id=... configured phases=['agent']
[gateway] apply_phase phase=agent configured=True default_action=allow internet_enabled=True n_rules=1
[gateway] phase=agent applied (rules deleted=0 created=1)
[gateway] apply_phase phase=verifier configured=False default_action=allow internet_enabled=True n_rules=0
[gateway] phase=verifier applied (rules deleted=1 created=0)
[gateway] delete_gateway_profile id=...
```

**Probes:** all 200/404 in both phases (same as baseline).

The `rules deleted=1` on the verifier boundary is the trace of the
agent-phase rule being cleaned up at the transition. Reward 1.0 in 19s.

---

## Trial A — agent-phase deny (load-bearing proof)

**Config:**
```yaml
gateway:
  agent:
    default_action: deny
    rules:
      - host_pattern: "api.anthropic.com"
        action: allow
```

**Trial log** (abridged — only `[gateway]` lines shown; gateway events are
emitted at debug level, surface them with `LOGLEVEL=DEBUG harbor run …`):
```
[gateway] create_gateway_profile name=harbor-... default_action=allow internet_enabled=True (boot permissive)
[gateway] apply_phase phase=agent configured=True default_action=deny internet_enabled=True n_rules=1
[gateway] phase=agent applied (rules deleted=0 created=1)
[gateway] apply_phase phase=verifier configured=False default_action=allow internet_enabled=True n_rules=0
[gateway] phase=verifier applied (rules deleted=1 created=0)
[gateway] delete_gateway_profile id=...
```

**Probes:**
```
phase=agent    url=https://api.anthropic.com/ http=404 rc=0   ← allowed
phase=agent    url=https://example.com/       http=403 rc=0   ← BLOCKED by gateway
phase=agent    url=https://pypi.org/simple/   http=403 rc=0   ← BLOCKED by gateway
phase=verifier url=https://api.anthropic.com/ http=404 rc=0   ← allowed
phase=verifier url=https://example.com/       http=200 rc=0   ← reverted to permissive
phase=verifier url=https://pypi.org/simple/   http=200 rc=0   ← reverted to permissive
```

The same `example.com` request that returns **403** during `agent.run`
returns **200** five seconds later in the verifier phase, on the same
sandbox. That is the proxy actually re-evaluating policy on a running
sandbox at the phase boundary. Reward 1.0 in 20s.

## Trial B — verifier-phase deny (inverse)

**Config:**
```yaml
gateway:
  verifier:
    default_action: deny
```

**Trial log** (abridged — only `[gateway]` lines shown; gateway events are
emitted at debug level, surface them with `LOGLEVEL=DEBUG harbor run …`):
```
[gateway] apply_phase phase=agent configured=False default_action=allow internet_enabled=True n_rules=0
[gateway] phase=agent applied (rules deleted=0 created=0)
[gateway] apply_phase phase=verifier configured=True default_action=deny internet_enabled=True n_rules=0
[gateway] phase=verifier applied (rules deleted=0 created=0)
```

**Probes:**
```
phase=agent    url=https://api.anthropic.com/ http=404 rc=0   ← reachable (permissive)
phase=agent    url=https://example.com/       http=200 rc=0   ← reachable
phase=agent    url=https://pypi.org/simple/   http=200 rc=0   ← reachable
phase=verifier url=https://api.anthropic.com/ http=403 rc=0   ← BLOCKED
phase=verifier url=https://example.com/       http=403 rc=0   ← BLOCKED
phase=verifier url=https://pypi.org/simple/   http=403 rc=0   ← BLOCKED
```

The mirror image of trial A: agent runs free, verifier locks down. Crucially
this proves the proxy invalidates "allow" decisions for hosts already
queried in a prior phase — `api.anthropic.com` was reached in `agent` and
then *blocked* in `verifier`. Reward 1.0 in 18s.

## Trial C — setup+agent phasing with real claude-code install

This is the realistic motivating workload: `claude-code` runs `apt-get
install` and `curl https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash` during
`agent.setup()`. Without phasing, those steps would have to run under the
agent-phase deny policy.

**Config:**
```yaml
gateway:
  setup:
    default_action: deny
    rules:
      - host_pattern: "deb.debian.org"
        action: allow
      - host_pattern: "security.debian.org"
        action: allow
      - host_pattern: "download.docker.com"
        action: allow
      - host_pattern: "claude.ai"
        action: allow
      - host_pattern: "downloads.claude.ai"
        action: allow
      - host_pattern: "*.anthropic.com"
        action: allow
      - host_pattern: "*.cloudfront.net"
        action: allow
      - host_pattern: "github.com"
        action: allow
      - host_pattern: "*.githubusercontent.com"
        action: allow
      - host_pattern: "registry.npmjs.org"
        action: allow
  agent:
    default_action: deny
    rules:
      - host_pattern: "api.anthropic.com"
        action: allow
```

**Trial log** (abridged — only `[gateway]` lines shown; gateway events are
emitted at debug level, surface them with `LOGLEVEL=DEBUG harbor run …`):
```
[gateway] create_gateway_profile name=harbor-... default_action=allow internet_enabled=True (boot permissive)
[gateway] ephemeral profile id=... configured phases=['agent', 'setup']
[gateway] apply_phase phase=setup configured=True default_action=deny internet_enabled=True n_rules=10
[gateway] phase=setup applied (rules deleted=0 created=10)
... claude-code agent.setup runs apt-get + curl claude.ai install ...
[gateway] apply_phase phase=agent configured=True default_action=deny internet_enabled=True n_rules=1
[gateway] phase=agent applied (rules deleted=10 created=1)
... claude-code agent.run ...
[gateway] apply_phase phase=verifier configured=False default_action=allow internet_enabled=True n_rules=0
[gateway] phase=verifier applied (rules deleted=1 created=0)
[gateway] delete_gateway_profile id=...
```

**Verifier probes** (the demo task probe set, run after claude-code finished):
```
phase=verifier url=https://api.anthropic.com/ http=404 rc=0
phase=verifier url=https://example.com/       http=200 rc=0
phase=verifier url=https://pypi.org/simple/   http=200 rc=0
```

(Setup-phase probe fixture isn't wired up — claude-code's own `setup` is
the workload here. The fact that it completed end-to-end is the proof: with
default-deny, only the 10 allowlisted hosts were reachable.)

**What this proves:**
1. Setup-phase policy fires **before** `agent.setup()` runs the install
   commands, and apt + claude.ai install succeed under the configured
   allowlist.
2. The agent boundary is a **real diff**: 10 rules deleted, 1 rule created
   — the live profile is mutated in place on a running sandbox.
3. Verifier reverts to permissive; the demo probe set confirms full egress
   is restored after `agent.run` ends.
4. End-to-end reward 1.0 in 45s with a real installed agent and a real
   verifier.

## Cross-trial verification — call sequence consistency

Every trial follows the same SDK-call shape, parameterized only by the
configured phases:

```
create_gateway_profile (boot permissive)        ← always (when any phase configured)
apply_phase setup    (configured=true|false)    ← before agent.setup
apply_phase agent    (configured=true|false)    ← before agent.run
apply_phase verifier (configured=true|false)    ← before verifier
delete_gateway_profile                          ← always, in stop()
```

The phase-application code path exercises the full SDK surface
(`update_gateway_profile`, `get_gateway_profile`, `delete_gateway_rule`,
`create_gateway_rule`) and the rule-diff arithmetic
(`rules deleted=N created=M`) is visible in every transition.
