## 1. `arXiv:2310.06770` | SWE-bench: Can Language Models Resolve Real-World GitHub Issues?

* **Authors:** Carlos E. Jimenez, John Yang, Alexander Wettig, Shunyu Yao, Kexin Pei, Ofir Press, Karthik Narasimhan (Princeton NLP).
* **Technical Reality:** This paper introduces a testbed of 2,294 engineering problems from 12 open-source Python repositories (e.g., `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `sympy`). Evaluation relies entirely on applying an LLM-generated patch file to a repository environment and executing its unit test suite to yield a binary $1$ (Resolved) or $0$ (Unresolved).
* **My Citation Justification:** This serves as my primary evaluation standard and the source dataset for my agent trajectories. I will cite it to anchor the current paradigm of automated, execution-based evaluation, paving the way for my argument that while outcome validation is objective, it hides structural flaws in the trajectory itself.

## 2. `arXiv:2405.15793` | SWE-agent: Agent-Computer Interfaces Enable Automated Software Engineering

* **Authors:** John Yang, Carlos E. Jimenez, Alexander Wettig, Kilian Lieret, Shunyu Yao, Karthik Narasimhan, Ofir Press (Princeton NLP).
* **Technical Reality:** This is the foundational paper that establishes SWE-agent and introduces the concept of the Agent-Computer Interface (ACI). It highlights how tailored, streamlined commands (for viewing, searching, and chunk-editing files) alongside defensive environmental feedback dramatically reduce the compound action error rates of language models.
* **My Citation Justification:** I will use their publicly released SWE-agent execution logs as part of my primary dataset. I will cite it in Sections 2 and 4 to illustrate how structural variations in an ACI shape the resulting step trajectories, providing the raw material that my Trajectory Behavioral Fingerprinting (TBF) framework converts into behavioral attributions.

## 3. `arXiv:2506.02064` | The Measurement Imbalance in Agentic AI Evaluation Undermines Industry Productivity Claims

* **Authors:** Kiana Jafari Meimandi, Gabriela Aránguiz-Dias, Grace Ra Kim, Lana Saadeddin, Allie Griffith, Mykel J. Kochenderfer (Stanford University).
* **Technical Reality:** A systematic review evaluating 84 papers published between 2023 and 2025. It proves that current evaluation practices exhibit a dangerous technical bias, where technical metrics dominate 83% of assessments, while safety (53%), human-centered (30%), and economic dimensions (30%) are isolated on the periphery. It presents clear case studies from industries like healthcare showing how systems excelling purely on baseline technical metrics break catastrophically upon real deployment due to unmeasured context and drift.
* **My Citation Justification:** This is the core validation for my Introduction (Section 1) and Discussion (Section 6). I am citing it to directly justify the critical need for process metrology over outcome metrics, anchoring my framework as a technical instrument to bridge the "measurement gap" they expose.

## 4. `arXiv:2308.03688` | AgentBench: Evaluating LLMs as Agents

* **Authors:** Xiao Liu, Hao Yu, Hanchen Zhang, Yifan Xu, Xuanyu Lei, Hanyu Lai, Yu Gu, Hangliang Ding, Kaiwen Men, Kejuan Yang, Shudan Zhang, Xiang Deng, Aohan Zeng, Zhengxiao Du, Chenhui Zhang, Sheng Shen, et al. (Tsinghua, ICLR 2024).
* **Technical Reality:** Introduces a multi-dimensional, multi-turn evolving benchmark spanning 8 distinct interactive environments (such as Operating Systems, Databases, Web Shopping, and Digital Card Games) designed to assess LLM reasoning and decision-making capabilities. It highlights how poor long-term reasoning and multi-turn instruction following act as the core failure points for open-source configurations compared to commercial counterparts.
* **My Citation Justification:** This serves as a fundamental survey for my Related Work (Section 2). I am citing it to show that while the agent community has built multi-turn interactive testbeds across diverse domains, evaluation remains tethered to task completion or episodic goal metrics rather than checking the aggregate process consistency of the generated step sequences.
